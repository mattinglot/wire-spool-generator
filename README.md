# Wire Spool Generator
OpenSCAD based wire spool generator that produces strong 3D printable spools suitable for winding electrical wire and similar material.

This is based on the original by Gladius with some key improvements:

* Stronger design because both rims have cores that mate with each other. The original had the core mating with a small indent in the rim. I found that tended to break.
* Enabling wire holes enables them in both rims.
* Tolerance is set in mm instead of %.
