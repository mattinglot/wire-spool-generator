# Wire Spool Generator
OpenSCAD based wire spool generator that produces strong 3D printable spools suitable for winding electrical wire and similar material.

This is based on the original by [Gladius](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/18981-customizeable-wire-spools) with some key improvements:

* Stronger design because both rims have cores that mate with each other. The original had the core mating with a small indent in the rim. I found this approach tended to break at the seam even with super glue.
* Enabling wire holes enables them in both rims instead of just the one.
* Tolerance is set in mm instead of %.
